THE HOUSES OF HEALING

shouting,’ she answered. ‘All I hope is that those murdering devils
do not come to this House and trouble the sick.’
Then Gandalf went out in haste, and already the ﬁre in the sky
was burning out, and the smouldering hills were fading, while ashgrey evening crept over the ﬁelds.
´
Now as the sun went down Aragorn and Eomer
and Imrahil drew
near the City with their captains and knights; and when they came
before the Gate Aragorn said:
‘Behold the Sun setting in a great ﬁre! It is a sign of the end and
fall of many things, and a change in the tides of the world. But this
City and realm has rested in the charge of the Stewards for many
long years, and I fear that if I enter it unbidden, then doubt and
debate may arise, which should not be while this war is fought. I will
not enter in, nor make any claim, until it be seen whether we or
Mordor shall prevail. Men shall pitch my tents upon the ﬁeld, and
here I will await the welcome of the Lord of the City.’
´
But Eomer
said: ‘Already you have raised the banner of the Kings
and displayed the tokens of Elendil’s House. Will you suffer these to
be challenged?’
‘No,’ said Aragorn. ‘But I deem the time unripe; and I have no
mind for strife except with our Enemy and his servants.’
And the Prince Imrahil said: ‘Your words, lord, are wise, if one
who is a kinsman of the Lord Denethor may counsel you in this
matter. He is strong-willed and proud, but old; and his mood has
been strange since his son was stricken down. Yet I would not have
you remain like a beggar at the door.’
‘Not a beggar,’ said Aragorn. ‘Say a captain of the Rangers, who
are unused to cities and houses of stone.’ And he commanded that
his banner should be furled; and he did off the Star of the North
Kingdom and gave it to the keeping of the sons of Elrond.
´
Then the Prince Imrahil and Eomer
of Rohan left him and passed
through the City and the tumult of the people, and mounted to the
Citadel; and they came to the Hall of the Tower, seeking the Steward.
But they found his chair empty, and before the dais lay Théoden
King of the Mark upon a bed of state; and twelve torches stood about
it, and twelve guards, knights both of Rohan and Gondor. And the
hangings of the bed were of green and white, but upon the king was
laid the great cloth of gold up to his breast, and upon that his
unsheathed sword, and at his feet his shield. The light of the torches
shimmered in his white hair like sun in the spray of a fountain, but
his face was fair and young, save that a peace lay on it beyond the
reach of youth; and it seemed that he slept.
